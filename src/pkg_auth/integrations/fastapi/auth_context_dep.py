"""``make_get_auth_context`` factory.

Composes ``Authentication.get_identity`` (from the authentication
module) with the authorization layer's ``ResolveAuthContextUseCase``,
either ``SyncUserFromJwtUseCase`` (Mode A — writer) or
``ResolveUserFromJwtUseCase`` (Mode B — reader), and
``OrganizationRepository`` to produce a single FastAPI dependency that
returns ``(IdentityContext, AuthContext)``.

Exactly one of ``sync_user_use_case`` / ``resolve_user_use_case`` must
be supplied:

- **Mode A** (source-of-truth, extends the ACL schema): pass
  ``sync_user_use_case=...`` — the dep will upsert the local user row
  from JWT claims on every request.
- **Mode B** (consumer, ACL DB is owned by a Mode A peer): pass
  ``resolve_user_use_case=...`` — the dep will read-through and raise
  ``UserNotProvisioned`` (→ HTTP 403) if the source-of-truth hasn't
  mirrored the user yet.

pkg_auth deliberately does NOT bake in a "platform admin fallback"
here. Platform-admin detection is a *service-level* policy: services
that want it call :func:`pkg_auth.authorization.is_platform_context`
inside handlers, comparing the request's ``AuthContext.organization_id``
against their own cached platform org id. Services that need
elevated-privilege fallbacks (resolving the caller against a platform
org when they aren't a member of the requested org) wrap this factory
in their own dependency. See ``docs/FastAPI.md`` for the canonical
pattern.

    The dependency:
        1. Resolves identity via the injected ``get_identity``.
        2. Either lazily upserts the local user row from JWT claims
           (Mode A) or reads it through and 403s if missing (Mode B).
        3. Reads ``header_name`` from the request and parses it as a
           UUID first, falling back to a slug lookup.
        4. Resolves the user's auth context for that organization.

    Errors map to:
