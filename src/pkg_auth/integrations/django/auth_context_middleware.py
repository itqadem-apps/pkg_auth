class AuthContextMiddleware:
    """Resolve and attach ``request.auth_context`` for protected routes.

    Requires ``IdentityMiddleware`` to run first so ``request.identity``
    is populated. Behavior:

        - no header → ``request.auth_context = None`` (route decides)
        - identity is None and header present → 401
        - org not found → 404
        - user not a member → 403

    pkg_auth deliberately does NOT bake in a "platform admin fallback"
    here. Platform-admin detection is a *service-level* policy: services
    that want it call :func:`pkg_auth.authorization.is_platform_context`
    inside views, comparing the request's ``AuthContext.organization_id``
    against their own cached platform org id. Services that need to
    *resolve* the caller against a platform org when they aren't a
    member of the requested org can subclass this middleware and
    intercept the ``NotAMember`` branch themselves.
