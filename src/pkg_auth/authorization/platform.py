"""Helpers for detecting platform-org context.

A "platform" organization is one whose members are granted cross-org
administrative privileges by the consuming service. There's nothing
special about its DB row — it's just an organization that the service
has designated as the platform org via configuration (slug, env var,
settings module, etc.).

The intended pattern:

1. The service caches the platform org's id at startup, e.g. by looking
   it up via slug from its ``OrganizationRepository`` in a lifespan or
   ``AppConfig.ready()`` hook. Where the cache lives is up to the
   service (module global, app config, request scope, …).
2. Platform admins send their requests with
   ``X-Organization-Id: <platform-org-slug>`` to surface their elevated
   privileges. The auth dependency builds an :class:`AuthContext` whose
   ``organization_id`` is the platform org id.
3. Inside handlers, the service calls
   :func:`is_platform_context` with the request's ``AuthContext`` and
   the cached platform org id. When it returns ``True``, the handler
   broadens its queryset filters (e.g. lists users from all orgs).

This module is intentionally stateless — pkg_auth does not own the
platform org id cache. Each consuming service decides where the cache
lives and when to refresh it.

    don't have a designated platform org — this returns ``False``,
