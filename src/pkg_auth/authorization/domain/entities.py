"""Authorization domain entities.

All entities are frozen dataclasses with slots. They are loaded from the
central ACL database by the SQLAlchemy / Django ORM repositories and
treated as immutable snapshots. The entities are schema-agnostic — the
concrete ``db_table`` / ``__tablename__`` values live in the adapter
layer, and source-of-truth services that extend the ACL tables (Mode A)
pick their own schema and table names via the mixin pattern.
