# Changelog

All notable changes to `pkg-auth` are documented here. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-20

### Breaking — permission catalogs sync over NATS

Mode B consumers can no longer UPSERT into the SoT's `permissions`
table directly — Vault-minted DB credentials are now `SELECT`-only
and scoped to each service's own database. Boot-time catalog
registration is inverted: consumers **publish** their catalog to NATS
JetStream, and itq_users **subscribes** and applies snapshots using
its own DB credential.

- New port: `PermissionCatalogPublisher` (mirrors the
  `register_many()` shape of `PermissionCatalogRepository`).
- New adapters: `NatsPermissionCatalogPublisher`,
  `PermissionCatalogSubscriber` under
  `pkg_auth.authorization.adapters.nats`.
- `RegisterPermissionCatalogUseCase.catalog_repo` renamed to
  `catalog_sink` (accepts either port).
- New `deleted_at` column on `permissions`
  (alembic revision `pkg_auth_acl_0003`) — snapshot-based removal
  soft-deletes absent keys to preserve `role_permissions` FKs.
- `nats-py>=2.6` is a new hard dependency.

[`docs/NATS-Catalog-Sync.md`](docs/NATS-Catalog-Sync.md).

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-16

### Breaking — Mode B consumers get a reader-only JWT use case

`SyncUserFromJwtUseCase` used to upsert the local `users` row on every
authenticated request, regardless of whether the service owned the
schema. For Mode B (consuming) services whose `ACL_DATABASE_URL`
points at a Mode A peer's database (e.g. `fri_fast_meetings` pointing
at `itq_users`), the bundled adapter's
`INSERT INTO users (keycloak_sub, email, full_name) ...` hit a
`NotNullViolationError` on `id` — and even with a defaulted `id`
would have written nulls into Mode A-owned extension columns,
corrupting the source-of-truth's invariants.

v2.0 splits the use case at the application layer:

- **`SyncUserFromJwtUseCase`** — unchanged, for Mode A (source-of-
  truth) services that own the `users` schema.
- **`ResolveUserFromJwtUseCase`** — new reader-only use case. Calls
  `UserRepository.get_by_keycloak_sub` and raises
  `UserNotProvisioned` (new `AuthorizationError` subclass) when the
  row is missing. Mode B services should use this.

The three integration factories now require exactly one of the two:

- `pkg_auth.integrations.fastapi.make_get_auth_context(...)`
- `pkg_auth.integrations.django.install_pkg_auth(...)`
- `pkg_auth.integrations.strawberry.make_context_getter(...)`

Each accepts `sync_user_use_case: ... | None = None` **xor**
`resolve_user_use_case: ... | None = None`. Passing both (or neither)
raises `ValueError` at factory-call time. No deprecation period — the
old positional-only `sync_user_use_case` signature is gone.

FastAPI and Django map `UserNotProvisioned` to **HTTP 403** (the
source-of-truth hasn't mirrored this user yet). Strawberry's
permissive context getter degrades `ctx.auth_context` to `None`.

### Breaking — example app (`itqadem_courses_app`) switched to Mode B

`examples/itqadem_courses_app/courses_app/deps.py` now wires
`ResolveUserFromJwtUseCase` — `itq_courses` is a Mode B consumer of
the `itq_users`-owned ACL. Mode A wiring is documented in
`docs/FastAPI.md` and `docs/Django.md`.

See `docs/MIGRATION_v2.md` for the full upgrade guide.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-04-15

### Breaking — Mode A and Mode B labels swapped

The two integration modes now match the naming used in the Engram
`pkg_auth Integration Guide` playbook and across the rest of the
itqadem fleet:

- **Mode A = Source-of-truth service** (extends the mixins, owns the
  ACL schema, runs its own migrations). `itq_users` is the canonical
  Mode A service.
- **Mode B = Consuming service** (reads the shared ACL tables via the
  bundled `*ORM` / mirror classes, no schema ownership). Services like
  `itq_courses` are Mode B.

Previous releases had the labels inverted in `docs/Django.md`, the
adapter docstrings, `src/pkg_auth/authorization/domain/entities.py`,
and the Alembic migration file names. All of those now match the
Engram convention. Any code or docs referencing "Mode A / Mode B"
from earlier versions must swap the labels.

### Breaking — bundled ACL tables no longer default to the `acl` schema

- `create_acl_base(schema=None)` is the new default (was `"acl"`).
  `AclBase` now emits unqualified table names, so Postgres resolves
  them via `search_path` — typically `public`, matching where the
  canonical SoT service (`itq_users`) already keeps the ACL tables.
- `src/pkg_auth/authorization/adapters/sqlalchemy/models.py` — the
  bundled `*ORM` classes dropped all `"acl.<table>.id"` FK string
  prefixes. They now reference unqualified names.
- `src/pkg_auth/authorization/adapters/django_orm/models.py` — the
  `managed=False` mirror models dropped the `acl"."` prefix on every
  `db_table`.
- Alembic migration `pkg_auth_acl_0001` renamed from
  `20260410_0001_initial_acl_schema.py` to `20260410_0001_initial_schema.py`.
  The migration no longer runs `CREATE SCHEMA acl` and no longer
  passes `schema="acl"` to any `op.create_table` / `op.create_index`
  / `op.drop_table` call.
- Alembic migration `pkg_auth_acl_0002_add_permission_is_platform`
  dropped `schema="acl"` from its `op.add_column` / `op.drop_column`.

Mode A services on previous versions that followed the bundled
migrations have their tables in the `acl` Postgres schema. They need
a one-off migration to move them into `public` (or their preferred
default schema) before upgrading — consult the SoT service's own
migration history (`itq_users` shipped
`a0b1c2d3e4f5_add_acl_tables_drop_acl_schema.py` for this purpose).

### Fixed — Strawberry integration parses `X-Organization-Id` the same way as FastAPI/Django

`src/pkg_auth/integrations/strawberry/auth.py` previously used a
legacy `raw.isdigit()` BIGINT fast-path that called
`OrgId(int(raw))`, which is unreachable code because `OrgId` wraps
`UUID`, not `int`. Replaced with a UUID-first parse that falls back
to slug lookup — matching the FastAPI `auth_context_dep` and Django
`AuthContextMiddleware` implementations.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added — `is_platform` permission scope

- `PermissionMixin.is_platform` (`Boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false`) on the
  SQLAlchemy and Django ORM mixins. Distinguishes permissions that operate
  inside a single organization from permissions that only make sense at
  platform/system level across organizations (e.g. `organizations:create`,
  `organizations:approve`).
- `Permission.is_platform: bool = False` on the domain entity.
- `CatalogEntry` dataclass for permission registration. Replaces the old
  2-tuple `(key, description)` shape with a clearer named structure that
  carries `is_platform`. Re-exported from `pkg_auth.authorization`.
- `PermissionScope` literal type (`"org" | "platform" | "all"`) and
  `scope=` keyword on `PermissionCatalogRepository.list_all()` and
  `PermissionCatalogRepository.list_for_service()`. The SQLAlchemy and
  Django implementations translate the scope to a SQL `WHERE` clause.
- Alembic migration `pkg_auth_acl_0002_add_permission_is_platform` adds
  the column to `acl.permissions` for SoT services.

### Backwards-compatible registration shapes

`RegisterPermissionCatalogUseCase.execute()` now accepts any of:

- `CatalogEntry(PermissionKey("..."), "desc", is_platform=True)`  *(preferred)*
- `(PermissionKey("..."), "desc")`         *(legacy 2-tuple — defaults `is_platform=False`)*
- `(PermissionKey("..."), "desc", True)`   *(legacy 3-tuple)*

Existing services upgrade by bumping `pkg-auth>=1.4.0`, applying the
column-add migration, and optionally migrating to the `CatalogEntry`
shape when they want to mark platform permissions.

### Added — multi-role per organization (Django adapter parity)

The SQLAlchemy adapter shipped multi-role support in v1.3 (unreleased);
v1.4 brings the Django adapter to parity:

- `Membership.unique_together = (("user", "organization", "role"),)` —
  one row per role; users can hold multiple roles in the same org.
- `DjangoMembershipRepository.load_auth_context()` aggregates the union
  of all *active* memberships and returns a single `AuthContext` with
  `role_names: frozenset[str]` and merged `perms`.
- `AuthContext.role_names` (frozenset) replaces the singular
  `role_name`. Use `ctx.has_role("editor")` for membership checks.
- `AuthContext.has(perm)` and `ctx.require(perm)` are unchanged.

### Platform-admin detection — service-level helper, not a flag

`AuthContext` deliberately does **not** carry an `is_platform: bool`
flag. Platform-admin detection is a *service-level* policy: the
consuming service designates one of its organizations as the "platform"
org and grants its members cross-org administrative privileges.

pkg_auth ships a stateless helper:

```python
from pkg_auth.authorization import is_platform_context

@require_permission("users:read")
async def list_users(request):
    auth_ctx = request.auth_context
    if is_platform_context(auth_ctx, cached_platform_org_id):
        users = User.objects.all()
    else:
        users = User.objects.filter(
            memberships__organization_id=auth_ctx.organization_id.value,
        )
    ...
```

The signature is:

```python
def is_platform_context(
    auth_ctx: AuthContext, platform_org_id: OrgId | None,
) -> bool: ...
```

Returns `True` when `auth_ctx.organization_id == platform_org_id`,
`False` otherwise (including when `platform_org_id` is `None`, e.g.
before the cache is initialized).

The consuming service is responsible for caching `platform_org_id`
wherever makes sense — module global, app config, request scope. A
typical pattern resolves the slug once at startup:

```python
_platform_org_id: OrgId | None = None

async def init_platform_org_id() -> None:
    global _platform_org_id
    org = await org_repo.get_by_slug("platform")
    if org is not None:
        _platform_org_id = org.id
```

**Why not a field on `AuthContext`?** Two ways to ask the same
question (a field on the dataclass *and* a helper) creates drift. The
helper-based approach also keeps `pkg_auth` decoupled from "what
counts as a platform admin" — that's a service-level policy, not a
package concern. See `docs/Django.md` for the full pattern.

### Added — Django adapter v1.4

### Added — Django adapter v1.4

- **UUID PKs everywhere.** All Django ORM models now use `UUIDField`
  PKs to match the SQLAlchemy schema (which moved to UUID in v1.2).
- **Abstract Django mixins** (`UserMixin`, `OrganizationMixin`,
  `PermissionMixin`, `RoleMixin`, `MembershipMixin`) under
  `pkg_auth.authorization.adapters.django_orm.mixins`. Mirror the
  SQLAlchemy mixin pattern: consuming services subclass the mixin to
  add their own columns and own the schema. Default `managed=False`
  concrete models in `models.py` inherit the mixins for services that
  don't need to extend.
- **Injectable model classes** on every Django repo
  (`DjangoUserRepository.model`, `DjangoMembershipRepository.role_model`,
  etc.). Lets services pass their own concrete subclasses without
  monkey-patching the package.
- `AuthContextMiddleware` now parses `X-Organization-Id` as a UUID
  first and falls back to slug lookup. The legacy `isdigit()` BIGINT
  fast-path is removed.
### Added — FastAPI adapter parity

- `make_get_auth_context(...)` parses the org header as UUID-or-slug
  instead of `isdigit()`.

### Test suite cleanup

Repaired pre-existing damage from a sed-based v1.2 UUID migration that
left the test suite in a non-collectible state:

- `tests/.../fakes.py` rewritten — type-correct UUIDs throughout,
  multi-role-aware `FakeMembershipRepository`, `CatalogEntry`-aware
  `FakePermissionCatalogRepository` with scope filtering.
- `tests/.../domain/test_value_objects.py` — meaningful equality and
  hashability assertions.
- `tests/.../domain/test_auth_context.py` — uses `role_names`,
  exercises `has_role()`, covers `is_platform`.
- `tests/.../application/test_*.py` — pass real `uuid4()` to
  `UserId/OrgId/RoleId` constructors instead of bare ints.

Test suite goes from 41 collected (6 collection errors, 10 failing) on
the v1.2 baseline to **85 passing / 0 failing** on v1.4.

### Migration guide

Consumers must:

1. Bump `pkg-auth>=1.4.0` in `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml`.
2. Run an Alembic migration to add the column on the `permissions` table:

   ```python
   op.add_column(
       "permissions",
       sa.Column(
           "is_platform",
           sa.Boolean(),
           nullable=False,
           server_default=sa.text("false"),
       ),
   )
   ```

   SoT services that re-use the package's Alembic branch can simply
   `alembic upgrade pkg_auth_acl@head`.
3. Migrate the permission catalog declaration to `CatalogEntry` for
   permissions that should be platform-only.
4. Drop any in-code workarounds (frozenset of platform perms, in-Python
   filters) — query the repo with `scope="platform"` instead.

### Notes for Django consumers

- The `default_auto_field` on the package's `AppConfig` is
  `BigAutoField` because Django requires an `AutoField` subclass and
  `UUIDField` isn't one. Every concrete ACL model declares its own
  `UUIDField` PK explicitly so this default is effectively unused.
- Importing the abstract mixins: use the explicit submodule, not the
  package `__init__`:
  `from pkg_auth.authorization.adapters.django_orm.mixins import UserMixin`.
  The `__init__.py` deliberately does NOT import the mixin module so
  Django's app loading order works correctly.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-11

### Multi-role per organization

A user can now hold multiple roles in the same organization. The
membership table's uniqueness moves from `(user, organization)` to
`(user, organization, role)`, and the auth context exposes the
union of all active roles' permissions:

- `Membership` schema: `UNIQUE(user_id, organization_id, role_id)`
  in the SQLAlchemy adapter; one row per role.
- `AuthContext.role_names: frozenset[str]` (renamed from singular
  `role_name`) — every active role the user holds in the active org.
- `AuthContext.perms` — union of all active roles' permission keys.
- `AuthContext.has_role(role: str) -> bool` — convenience check.
- `MembershipRepository.load_auth_context()` aggregates the union
  in a single query (with `selectinload`/`prefetch_related`).

### Migration

Consumers must migrate the `memberships` table's unique constraint:

```python
op.drop_constraint("uq_memberships_user_org", "memberships")
op.create_unique_constraint(
    "uq_memberships_user_org_role",
    "memberships",
    ["user_id", "organization_id", "role_id"],
)
```

Handler call sites that read `auth_ctx.role_name` (singular) must
move to `auth_ctx.role_names` (frozenset) or `auth_ctx.has_role(...)`.
